  <div class="stackedit__html"><p><strong>Catalog</strong> <strong>-</strong> Catalogs are a way to keep products of various types from being ordered together, and can have the same structure of templates and options in a templates file. Just add a Catalog to the root of the template item tree, then add templates and options to it as if it were its own file. When a user switches catalogs and there are items in the order, they will be prompted for confirmation to drop the current order and start a new one.  This is useful for separating product or service areas and protecting your desired lab workflow/rules, i.e. order minimums or certain print types, proof prints vs. standard sizes, corrected vs. uncorrected work, metallic paper vs. standard paper types, etc.  A sample showing examples of how one might list Catalogs can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Catalogs.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Catalogs.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration</strong> <strong>–</strong> The Configuration element allows you to set FTP and other values for your ROES Client and override any settings stored in the client startup configuration on the SoftWorks’ deployment sites.  This allows for better protection of FTP credentials, since you can encrypt your templates file with your order file password.  You can set the Configuration off of the root of the templates file to take effect for all Catalogs in that file, or you can set it inside each of the Catalogs to allow for different drop folders or Internet addresses to connect to when uploading from that catalog (for instance, if you are running different ROES Servers to handle different catalog workflows).  If you add the Configuration element to one Catalog you must add it in all other Catalogs for proper functionality.  Attributes also found under Configuration allow you to control the banner and taskbar icon set inside the ROES Client, along with the Internet URL to connect to when the banner is clicked.  A sample showing examples of how one might list a single Configuration for RTP off the root of the templates fle can be found at <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Configuration.zip"></a><a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/RTPinTemplates.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/</a><a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/RTPinTemplates.zip">RTPinTemplates.zip</a>, one showing Configuration for RTP set separately within each Catalog (using different ports) can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/RTPinCatalogs.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/RTPinCatalogs.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Customer</strong> <strong>– The Customer element allows you to define specific product groups or entire separate templates files for individual customers.</strong> Adding a Customer off the root of the templates file allows you to specify a customer-specific templates file, which will be loaded when that user launches the ROES Client to apply special pricing, products, or options for that customer or a group of customers. Add the customer to the templates file, then modify the “id” attribute to be their account number that they will enter into the Customer Information window. Then, in the “url” attribute, type the URL to the specific templates file. The customer id and URL are encrypted when saved, so other customers cannot see where the other templates file is on the Web.  Be certain that customer-specific templates do not have customers on them (only the default templates file should) as if the same customer id is listed it can throw the application into a loop (continuously calling to download the same templates file over and over).  A sample showing examples of how one might set up Customers can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Customer_Example.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Customer_Example.zip</a>, including one set off the first Catalog to show as an extra tab only for that customer.</p>
<p><strong>Image Options</strong>  - These are for services like retouching, head swaps, glare removal or other image-specific services.  To add Image Options, first select “Image Options” from the “Add” menu. This will create a group of that name under the root “templates” to which you can add Options. These will appear in the “Image Options” menu in the Options menu, for each image in each node.  You can also have drag and drop the Image Options onto a Catalog, instead of leaving one universal Image Options off the templates root, in order to offer different services with different catalogs.  In multinode products, different image options can be added to each individual image.  A sample showing Image Options can be found at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Image_Options_Example.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Image_Options_Example.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Item Options</strong>  - These are for universal options you want to offer on all sizes in a catalog.  Like Image Options, select “Item Options” from the “Add” menu to create a group for Item Options first.  Item Options are always shown in the Options menu/palette within the Catalog they exist in.  A sample showing Item Options can be found at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/ItemOpts.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/ItemOpts.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Link</strong> <strong>– Link is a very powerful and space-saving tool to use within your templates file.  It allows you to replicate options or option sets anywhere in the templates setup – even across catalogs.  The link to the item(s) is based on the u_id value, so if an entire option set is desired to be automatically replicated in the program from a single source, you would only need to link to the parent option u_id value. The Link element can be created 2 ways when working in your templates file.  First, you can click on a template or option to select it, then click Add and choose Link, then type in the u_id of the desired option or option set parent. Second, you can select the option you wish to link to, right-click on it and choose Create Link for Item.  This will generate a new Link element underneath the option or option set to be linked to.  You can then drag/drop or cut/paste the link anywhere you need to in the templates file. It is advisable to manually enter your own u_id value for an option set to be linked to before creating the Link, so as to better recognize the Link when it appears in your templates file. So for an option set to change fonts, you can manually set the parent option set, maybe labeled Font Type, u_id value to FontType, then generate a link for it via the right-click contextual menu.  This will then show Link: FontType instead of Link: -7fd4 and allow you or anyone looking at the templates file to easily see what that Link goes to without needing to trace the Link to its’ source.  A common practice is to create an option outside of your catalogs, off the root of the templates file, and label it Linked Options.  Create your option sets under here and then generate Links for each and use the Links where needed, allowing you to have a single location for most of your commonly used options – and make doing pricing changes or option changes easier without needing to search for them.</strong> A sample showing Links can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Links.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Links.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LinkNodes</strong> <strong>- Link****Nodes</strong>  allow you to replicate images across nodes in a layout when so that an item using the same images, i.e. 8 wallets, can be truly rendered in the crop area.  LinkNodes was built primarily for use with orders going into our Stand Alone Rendering Server, and does not need to be used for labs with DP2 or Fuji PIC Pro, where the layout files set the image in the first node to be copied to the others.  A file showing Linknodes can be found at  <a href="http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Linknodes_Example.zip">http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Linknodes_Example.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Masks/Mask</strong>  - The Masks element is for setting up masks, such as sloppy borders to offer via the node tools. See the Masks and Tints PDF at  <a href="http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Linknodes_Example.zip">http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/</a>Masks_and_Tints_Setup_v2.pdf.</p>
<p><strong>Node</strong> <strong>-</strong> Nodes represent the areas in a template which allow images or text to be added to a product. Every area which can accept a user image is a node.  Nodes at their simplest have bounds like a template, and an id which is the DP2 layout id. A template can have any number of nodes, from 3.5x5 single image prints to 24 mini-proof sheet nodes on a 10x13. Nodes can also be used to add graphics to a product for product explanation and advertising within a catalog.</p>
<p><strong>Option</strong> <strong>-</strong> Options are the ROES objects that are used to represent services you wish to offer on your products.  Common options used are: Image Tone changes, Mounting, Finishes/Sprays, Sloppy Borders, Retouching services, Customer/event references, and text fonts and colors. Options come in several varieties.  <strong>Template Options</strong>  - These are services for an individual size, and appear in the Options menu in the ROES Client when the specific template/size/product is selected.  These can also be added to template groups, so that an entire group of templates will “inherit” the options, and they will appear when any of the templates in the group are selected.  Options like Mounting and Sprays are normally priced per each product/print size, so would be listed directly off the template they apply to.  Options for things like Image Tone changes can apply to an entire group of products, so could get listed inside a template group to appear for all of them, saving space in the templates file and always showing when any product in that particular group is selected.  A sample showing basic Options can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Options.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Options.zip</a>; most examples of specific Attributes are listed further below in the Attributes areas.</p>
<p><strong>Override Addition</strong> <strong>-</strong> Override Additions, which appear as +overridesadd in the tree upon being added, are used off of Options to make changes happen in ROES.  Attributes listed on an overridesadd will either replace (override) or add new (add, thus overridesadd) attributes to the template currently selected in the crop area.  Setting a color attribute on an overridesadd will allow you to make the color shown, such as black, appear in the background of the product (in the template area, behind nodes).  Various template-level attributes such as preferredqueue, id, layoutfile, and layoutimage (be sure to add backgroundbackground with it) can be set directly on the overridesadd to alter or set new characteristics of the template.  To make changes to a node or nodes in a template, at least one node must be added off the overridesadd.  The u_id value of the node to receive the change must be set on this node so that the overriding or additional attributes can be properly applied (be sure that all nodes in a template have a u_id assigned).  Common node attributes used to cause various effects are monochrome (for black and white/sepia changes), stroke… attributes to set strokes/pinstriping on nodes/images, bounds to change the location and/or size of a node, input to convert a node from image to none/text or vice versa, nodeimage to use as a design element, noderotation to rotate a node, color to change text color, font to change a text font, and opacity to make an image in a node appear opaque/transparent.  A sample showing 2 basic Options with override additions with a can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip</a>; most examples of specific Attributes are listed further below in the Attributes areas.</p>
<p><strong>TIP: Use the right-click contextual menu to ensure all nodes in a template get u_id’s assigned. Select one or more templates, then right-click on one of them and select Copy Attributes.  The dialog window will list id to Copy from and u_id to Copy To, so simply select Node from the drop down list in the third field and click OK. Now all nodes will have their id values also set as their u_id values (and the u_id attribute will be added if not present) and Options with Override Additions can be used to effect changes as needed).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Override Add Node</strong> <strong>– An overrideaddnode can be used to add additional nodes into a template via an Option selection.  When added off an overridesadd, the overrideaddnode should have an id, bounds to locate in the template, and u_id values assigned, with the id and u_id being unique in the template the Option is being used on</strong>.  A sample showing simple use of overrideaddnode can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Override Removal</strong> <strong>- An overridesremove is the opposite of an overridesadd, it can be used to remove attributes or, with overrideremovenode, one or more nodes in a template via an Option selection</strong>.  An overridesremove is added off an Option, with attributes set on it or, usually, an overrideremovenode added off it.  A sample showing simple use of override removal can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Override Remove Node</strong> <strong>- An overrideremovenode can be used to remove one or more nodes in a template via an Option selection</strong>.  <strong>.  When added off an overridesremove, the overrideremovenode should have a u_id corresponding to the unique node in the template the Option is being used on</strong>.  A sample showing simple use of overrideremovenode can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Order Options</strong>  - Order Options are options you want to appear at the end of the order process and will only appear during the Review Order window in the ROES Client.  These can be universal and set off the templates root or off of each catalog so that different options can be offered for each type of workflow area.  To add, first select “Order Options” from the “Add” menu, then add options or option sets. Options in the Order Options group will appear in the Order Review. These are useful for shipping &amp; rush options that affect an entire order.  A sample showing Order Options can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OrderOpts.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OrderOpts.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Records -</strong> The Records element allows defining pre-sets for table fields to properly fill DP2 Records tables and/or match to templates and macros they contain for matching fields to nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping –</strong> The Shipping element is only needed for the newer ROES Retail interface to set the shipping methods to be chosen in the checkout pane.  Shipping should be added inside each catalog offered, much like Order Options.  Each shipping element should have one or more Shipping Method elements added off of it to create and define the shipping selections.  A sample showing Shipping can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Shipping.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Shipping.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping Method</strong> - The Shipping Method elements should be added off of Shipping in the newer ROES Retail interface to define shipping selections in the checkout pane.  Attributes available are similar to those offered off of Options, so the same values used for shipping selections in Order Options currently can be used in Shipping Method – label, price, tiertype, and uses are the primary ones to set the needed values for display and calculation.  A sample file showing Shipping with Shipping Methods with tiered pricing and label usage can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Shipping.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Shipping.zip</a>.  <strong>TIP: Do not remove id and/or price from the Shipping Method.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SplashTip -</strong> The SplashTip is a message shown when the application launches. This is useful for greetings and communicating new products or specials of the week/month to your customers. To change the splashtip, select it, then look at the attributes shown in the pane to the right. A “text” attribute is shown there, which can be a message that you type in plain or html encoded text or a URL of the form:  <strong><a href="http://www.labdomain.com/ROES/splashtip.html">http://www.labdomain.com/ROES/splashtip.html</a>.</strong> <strong>Any</strong>  link that a user clicks on in the splashtip will open a new browser window, so you can set up links in the splashtip page for registering with your lab.  In the new ROES Retail UI, you can also create ‘ROES links’ to templates in the program, by setting an internal URL path using the u_id’s of the Catalog, Template Group(s), and Template.  So if you have a catalog labeled Corrected, a template group labeled Standard, and a template labeled 8x10, and you manually named u_id’s to match the label, you could set a link of roes://Corrected/Standard/8x10 in your HTML splash page and the program would jump to the item when clicked in the Start/Home/Specials pane.</p>
<p><strong>Template</strong> <strong>-</strong> Templates are the ROES objects that are used to represent your products to your customers. Using the basic Template Tool features, each product will have one template to represent it.  To create a template group, represented by a tab in the ROES Client or a menu with submenu items, just add a template to another one, and the “parent” template will be shown as a group.  To create a template from a DP2 layout or  Fuji  unit file, just drag the layout file from your file system into the template tree, and it will be added to whatever item on which you drop it.  If you drag multiple items in, a template will be created for each one.  For this reason, it is sensible to create your template groups first, then drag the applicable items into each group. However, the items can also be cut and pasted if new groups are needed later.</p>
<p><strong>Tints/Tint</strong>  - The Masks element is for setting up masks, such as sloppy borders to offer via the node tools. See the Masks and Tints PDF at  <a href="http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Linknodes_Example.zip">http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/</a>Masks_and_Tints_Setup_v2.pdf.</p>
<p><strong>Unit</strong> - ROES supports unit pricing, where multiple templates can be assigned the same tiered pricing scheme and allow volume discounts to apply to all products set with a specific  <strong>unitu_id</strong>  value. The  <strong>Unit</strong>  element should be added inside a catalog, at the same level as Order Options and Image Options (not inside a template group). The attributes  <strong>price</strong>,  <strong>unitu_id</strong>  and  <strong>u_id</strong>  should be present on Unit, with  <strong>tiertype</strong>  as an option and set to graded. On the templates, set attributes  <strong>unitquantity</strong>  and  <strong>unitu_id</strong>. The unitu_id should match the unitu_id for the specific Unit element this template should get pricing from, and the unitquantity should be set to at least 1. If offering half-units, set the id value to 1 and the full units to 2, and adjust the price value on the Unit element to be for half-units, which will be doubled for each full unit.  A sample showing Units with full and half unit examples can be found at</p>
