  <div class="stackedit__html"><p><strong>Catalog</strong> <strong>-</strong> Catalogs are a way to keep products of various types from being ordered together, and can have the same structure of templates and options in a templates file. Just add a Catalog to the root of the template item tree, then add templates and options to it as if it were its own file. When a user switches catalogs and there are items in the order, they will be prompted for confirmation to drop the current order and start a new one.  This is useful for separating product or service areas and protecting your desired lab workflow/rules, i.e. order minimums or certain print types, proof prints vs. standard sizes, corrected vs. uncorrected work, metallic paper vs. standard paper types, etc.  A sample showing examples of how one might list Catalogs can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Catalogs.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Catalogs.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration</strong> <strong>–</strong> The Configuration element allows you to set FTP and other values for your ROES Client and override any settings stored in the client startup configuration on the SoftWorks’ deployment sites.  This allows for better protection of FTP credentials, since you can encrypt your templates file with your order file password.  You can set the Configuration off of the root of the templates file to take effect for all Catalogs in that file, or you can set it inside each of the Catalogs to allow for different drop folders or Internet addresses to connect to when uploading from that catalog (for instance, if you are running different ROES Servers to handle different catalog workflows).  If you add the Configuration element to one Catalog you must add it in all other Catalogs for proper functionality.  Attributes also found under Configuration allow you to control the banner and taskbar icon set inside the ROES Client, along with the Internet URL to connect to when the banner is clicked.  A sample showing examples of how one might list a single Configuration for RTP off the root of the templates fle can be found at <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Configuration.zip"></a><a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/RTPinTemplates.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/</a><a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/RTPinTemplates.zip">RTPinTemplates.zip</a>, one showing Configuration for RTP set separately within each Catalog (using different ports) can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/RTPinCatalogs.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/RTPinCatalogs.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Customer</strong> <strong>– The Customer element allows you to define specific product groups or entire separate templates files for individual customers.</strong> Adding a Customer off the root of the templates file allows you to specify a customer-specific templates file, which will be loaded when that user launches the ROES Client to apply special pricing, products, or options for that customer or a group of customers. Add the customer to the templates file, then modify the “id” attribute to be their account number that they will enter into the Customer Information window. Then, in the “url” attribute, type the URL to the specific templates file. The customer id and URL are encrypted when saved, so other customers cannot see where the other templates file is on the Web.  Be certain that customer-specific templates do not have customers on them (only the default templates file should) as if the same customer id is listed it can throw the application into a loop (continuously calling to download the same templates file over and over).  A sample showing examples of how one might set up Customers can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Customer_Example.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Customer_Example.zip</a>, including one set off the first Catalog to show as an extra tab only for that customer.</p>
<p><strong>Image Options</strong>  - These are for services like retouching, head swaps, glare removal or other image-specific services.  To add Image Options, first select “Image Options” from the “Add” menu. This will create a group of that name under the root “templates” to which you can add Options. These will appear in the “Image Options” menu in the Options menu, for each image in each node.  You can also have drag and drop the Image Options onto a Catalog, instead of leaving one universal Image Options off the templates root, in order to offer different services with different catalogs.  In multinode products, different image options can be added to each individual image.  A sample showing Image Options can be found at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Image_Options_Example.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Image_Options_Example.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Item Options</strong>  - These are for universal options you want to offer on all sizes in a catalog.  Like Image Options, select “Item Options” from the “Add” menu to create a group for Item Options first.  Item Options are always shown in the Options menu/palette within the Catalog they exist in.  A sample showing Item Options can be found at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/ItemOpts.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/ItemOpts.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Link</strong> <strong>– Link is a very powerful and space-saving tool to use within your templates file.  It allows you to replicate options or option sets anywhere in the templates setup – even across catalogs.  The link to the item(s) is based on the u_id value, so if an entire option set is desired to be automatically replicated in the program from a single source, you would only need to link to the parent option u_id value. The Link element can be created 2 ways when working in your templates file.  First, you can click on a template or option to select it, then click Add and choose Link, then type in the u_id of the desired option or option set parent. Second, you can select the option you wish to link to, right-click on it and choose Create Link for Item.  This will generate a new Link element underneath the option or option set to be linked to.  You can then drag/drop or cut/paste the link anywhere you need to in the templates file. It is advisable to manually enter your own u_id value for an option set to be linked to before creating the Link, so as to better recognize the Link when it appears in your templates file. So for an option set to change fonts, you can manually set the parent option set, maybe labeled Font Type, u_id value to FontType, then generate a link for it via the right-click contextual menu.  This will then show Link: FontType instead of Link: -7fd4 and allow you or anyone looking at the templates file to easily see what that Link goes to without needing to trace the Link to its’ source.  A common practice is to create an option outside of your catalogs, off the root of the templates file, and label it Linked Options.  Create your option sets under here and then generate Links for each and use the Links where needed, allowing you to have a single location for most of your commonly used options – and make doing pricing changes or option changes easier without needing to search for them.</strong> A sample showing Links can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Links.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Links.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LinkNodes</strong> <strong>- Link****Nodes</strong>  allow you to replicate images across nodes in a layout when so that an item using the same images, i.e. 8 wallets, can be truly rendered in the crop area.  LinkNodes was built primarily for use with orders going into our Stand Alone Rendering Server, and does not need to be used for labs with DP2 or Fuji PIC Pro, where the layout files set the image in the first node to be copied to the others.  A file showing Linknodes can be found at  <a href="http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Linknodes_Example.zip">http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Linknodes_Example.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Masks/Mask</strong>  - The Masks element is for setting up masks, such as sloppy borders to offer via the node tools. See the Masks and Tints PDF at  <a href="http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Linknodes_Example.zip">http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/</a>Masks_and_Tints_Setup_v2.pdf.</p>
<p><strong>Node</strong> <strong>-</strong> Nodes represent the areas in a template which allow images or text to be added to a product. Every area which can accept a user image is a node.  Nodes at their simplest have bounds like a template, and an id which is the DP2 layout id. A template can have any number of nodes, from 3.5x5 single image prints to 24 mini-proof sheet nodes on a 10x13. Nodes can also be used to add graphics to a product for product explanation and advertising within a catalog.</p>
<p><strong>Option</strong> <strong>-</strong> Options are the ROES objects that are used to represent services you wish to offer on your products.  Common options used are: Image Tone changes, Mounting, Finishes/Sprays, Sloppy Borders, Retouching services, Customer/event references, and text fonts and colors. Options come in several varieties.  <strong>Template Options</strong>  - These are services for an individual size, and appear in the Options menu in the ROES Client when the specific template/size/product is selected.  These can also be added to template groups, so that an entire group of templates will “inherit” the options, and they will appear when any of the templates in the group are selected.  Options like Mounting and Sprays are normally priced per each product/print size, so would be listed directly off the template they apply to.  Options for things like Image Tone changes can apply to an entire group of products, so could get listed inside a template group to appear for all of them, saving space in the templates file and always showing when any product in that particular group is selected.  A sample showing basic Options can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Options.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Options.zip</a>; most examples of specific Attributes are listed further below in the Attributes areas.</p>
<p><strong>Override Addition</strong> <strong>-</strong> Override Additions, which appear as +overridesadd in the tree upon being added, are used off of Options to make changes happen in ROES.  Attributes listed on an overridesadd will either replace (override) or add new (add, thus overridesadd) attributes to the template currently selected in the crop area.  Setting a color attribute on an overridesadd will allow you to make the color shown, such as black, appear in the background of the product (in the template area, behind nodes).  Various template-level attributes such as preferredqueue, id, layoutfile, and layoutimage (be sure to add backgroundbackground with it) can be set directly on the overridesadd to alter or set new characteristics of the template.  To make changes to a node or nodes in a template, at least one node must be added off the overridesadd.  The u_id value of the node to receive the change must be set on this node so that the overriding or additional attributes can be properly applied (be sure that all nodes in a template have a u_id assigned).  Common node attributes used to cause various effects are monochrome (for black and white/sepia changes), stroke… attributes to set strokes/pinstriping on nodes/images, bounds to change the location and/or size of a node, input to convert a node from image to none/text or vice versa, nodeimage to use as a design element, noderotation to rotate a node, color to change text color, font to change a text font, and opacity to make an image in a node appear opaque/transparent.  A sample showing 2 basic Options with override additions with a can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip</a>; most examples of specific Attributes are listed further below in the Attributes areas.</p>
<p><strong>TIP: Use the right-click contextual menu to ensure all nodes in a template get u_id’s assigned. Select one or more templates, then right-click on one of them and select Copy Attributes.  The dialog window will list id to Copy from and u_id to Copy To, so simply select Node from the drop down list in the third field and click OK. Now all nodes will have their id values also set as their u_id values (and the u_id attribute will be added if not present) and Options with Override Additions can be used to effect changes as needed).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Override Add Node</strong> <strong>– An overrideaddnode can be used to add additional nodes into a template via an Option selection.  When added off an overridesadd, the overrideaddnode should have an id, bounds to locate in the template, and u_id values assigned, with the id and u_id being unique in the template the Option is being used on</strong>.  A sample showing simple use of overrideaddnode can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Override Removal</strong> <strong>- An overridesremove is the opposite of an overridesadd, it can be used to remove attributes or, with overrideremovenode, one or more nodes in a template via an Option selection</strong>.  An overridesremove is added off an Option, with attributes set on it or, usually, an overrideremovenode added off it.  A sample showing simple use of override removal can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Override Remove Node</strong> <strong>- An overrideremovenode can be used to remove one or more nodes in a template via an Option selection</strong>.  <strong>.  When added off an overridesremove, the overrideremovenode should have a u_id corresponding to the unique node in the template the Option is being used on</strong>.  A sample showing simple use of overrideremovenode can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OverridesAdd.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Order Options</strong>  - Order Options are options you want to appear at the end of the order process and will only appear during the Review Order window in the ROES Client.  These can be universal and set off the templates root or off of each catalog so that different options can be offered for each type of workflow area.  To add, first select “Order Options” from the “Add” menu, then add options or option sets. Options in the Order Options group will appear in the Order Review. These are useful for shipping &amp; rush options that affect an entire order.  A sample showing Order Options can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OrderOpts.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/OrderOpts.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Records -</strong> The Records element allows defining pre-sets for table fields to properly fill DP2 Records tables and/or match to templates and macros they contain for matching fields to nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping –</strong> The Shipping element is only needed for the newer ROES Retail interface to set the shipping methods to be chosen in the checkout pane.  Shipping should be added inside each catalog offered, much like Order Options.  Each shipping element should have one or more Shipping Method elements added off of it to create and define the shipping selections.  A sample showing Shipping can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Shipping.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Shipping.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping Method</strong> - The Shipping Method elements should be added off of Shipping in the newer ROES Retail interface to define shipping selections in the checkout pane.  Attributes available are similar to those offered off of Options, so the same values used for shipping selections in Order Options currently can be used in Shipping Method – label, price, tiertype, and uses are the primary ones to set the needed values for display and calculation.  A sample file showing Shipping with Shipping Methods with tiered pricing and label usage can be found at  <a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Shipping.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Shipping.zip</a>.  <strong>TIP: Do not remove id and/or price from the Shipping Method.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SplashTip -</strong> The SplashTip is a message shown when the application launches. This is useful for greetings and communicating new products or specials of the week/month to your customers. To change the splashtip, select it, then look at the attributes shown in the pane to the right. A “text” attribute is shown there, which can be a message that you type in plain or html encoded text or a URL of the form:  <strong><a href="http://www.labdomain.com/ROES/splashtip.html">http://www.labdomain.com/ROES/splashtip.html</a>.</strong> <strong>Any</strong>  link that a user clicks on in the splashtip will open a new browser window, so you can set up links in the splashtip page for registering with your lab.  In the new ROES Retail UI, you can also create ‘ROES links’ to templates in the program, by setting an internal URL path using the u_id’s of the Catalog, Template Group(s), and Template.  So if you have a catalog labeled Corrected, a template group labeled Standard, and a template labeled 8x10, and you manually named u_id’s to match the label, you could set a link of roes://Corrected/Standard/8x10 in your HTML splash page and the program would jump to the item when clicked in the Start/Home/Specials pane.</p>
<p><strong>Template</strong> <strong>-</strong> Templates are the ROES objects that are used to represent your products to your customers. Using the basic Template Tool features, each product will have one template to represent it.  To create a template group, represented by a tab in the ROES Client or a menu with submenu items, just add a template to another one, and the “parent” template will be shown as a group.  To create a template from a DP2 layout or  Fuji  unit file, just drag the layout file from your file system into the template tree, and it will be added to whatever item on which you drop it.  If you drag multiple items in, a template will be created for each one.  For this reason, it is sensible to create your template groups first, then drag the applicable items into each group. However, the items can also be cut and pasted if new groups are needed later.</p>
<p><strong>Tints/Tint</strong>  - The Masks element is for setting up masks, such as sloppy borders to offer via the node tools. See the Masks and Tints PDF at  <a href="http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Linknodes_Example.zip">http://www.roesu.com/Training/TTool8/</a>Masks_and_Tints_Setup_v2.pdf.</p>
<p><strong>Unit</strong> - ROES supports unit pricing, where multiple templates can be assigned the same tiered pricing scheme and allow volume discounts to apply to all products set with a specific  <strong>unitu_id</strong>  value. The  <strong>Unit</strong>  element should be added inside a catalog, at the same level as Order Options and Image Options (not inside a template group). The attributes  <strong>price</strong>,  <strong>unitu_id</strong>  and  <strong>u_id</strong>  should be present on Unit, with  <strong>tiertype</strong>  as an option and set to graded. On the templates, set attributes  <strong>unitquantity</strong>  and  <strong>unitu_id</strong>. The unitu_id should match the unitu_id for the specific Unit element this template should get pricing from, and the unitquantity should be set to at least 1. If offering half-units, set the id value to 1 and the full units to 2, and adjust the price value on the Unit element to be for half-units, which will be doubled for each full unit.  A sample showing Units with full and half unit examples can be found at</p>
<p><a href="http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Units_Example.zip">http://www.roes-u.com/Training/TTool8/Examples/Units_Example.zip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>emplate/Product Attributes</strong> - these attributes are added directly onto a template or product size or on an overridesadd element to alter a template via an option selection.</p>
<p><strong>addenabled</strong> - set to true on a template/product to allow it to be ordered with empty nodes (i.e. a proof book page where the customer may only have 7 images for a 9-up sheet) or set to false on an informational template so that it can never be added to the order (a template with a JPEG layoutimage used as the first item in the catalog to advise on a minimum order amount).<br>
<strong>true</strong> “Add to Order” button is always enabled, even with empty nodes<br>
<strong>false</strong> “Add to Order” button is never enabled</p>
<p><strong>addpagepaircount</strong>  - Number of pages to add/remove inside a book when user clicks to add or remove a page, default is 1, set to 2 for 4 pages, or 2 pairs, per add/remove.</p>
<p><strong>autorotate</strong> - use this attribute to force de-selection of the autorotate button in the pro toolbar<br>
<strong>true</strong> user autorotate preference is preserved (no changes made)<br>
<strong>false</strong> user autorotate preference is set to off when this template is selected</p>
<p><strong>autoenqueue</strong> - Stand Alone Server use only - use this attribute to define whether or not product is to be enqueued for rendering/printing/fed to back end system when order is processed.  This attribute will override the Auto-Enqueue checkbox in the Options tab.<br>
<strong>true</strong> Enqueue template at time of order processing<br>
<strong>false</strong> Do not enqueue template at time of order processing</p>
<p><strong>backgroundbackground</strong> - used to add a background image onto a product for presentation in the client, used with layoutimage.  Used on memory mates, trader cards, greeting cards, calendars and even proof book or album pages.<br>
<strong>true</strong> layout background defined in layoutimage is plotted behind user images (most common use)<br>
<strong>false</strong> layout background defined in layoutimage is plotted over user images, where part of the background should mask a part of the image(s)</p>
<p><strong>basequantity</strong> - the base quantity of this template when packaged</p>
<p><strong>bounding</strong></p>
<p><strong>true</strong> the bounding, or outermost, template in a package<br>
<strong>false</strong> a non bounding template in a package</p>
<p><strong>bounds</strong> - bounds for the layout overall size</p>
<p><strong>clearonaddtoorder</strong> - use this attribute to clear image(s) and text from a template when it is added to an order.<br>
<strong>true</strong> clear image(s) and text from a template when it is added to an order<br>
<strong>false</strong> clearonaddtoorder should never be used false as this is the default condition in ROES</p>
<p><strong>color</strong> - background color for template (i.e. black for an album page)</p>
<p><strong>containertype</strong>  - defines this template as a container of other templates to form a single item or entity within an item</p>
<p><strong>package</strong>  This template parents a package</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>  This template parents a book</p>
<p><strong>section</strong>  This template parents a book section</p>
<p><strong>stack</strong>  This template contains a stack</p>
<p><strong>coversection</strong> - Defines cover section of a ROES book, only used on template with containertype of section.  The default value is true, meaning that the one section should act as the front and back cover of the ROES book.</p>
<p><strong>cropbackground</strong> - RGB values to use in crop area background for this template, default is 195,195,195.</p>
<p><strong>defaulttemplate</strong> - Enter template u_id to fill ROES book pages by default when blank page is viewed or a page pair is added. To use 2 different pages for a page pair add, use a comma delimited set of of u_id’s for the 2 desired templates (templates must exist in the section’s templates!).</p>
<p><strong>disableu_idonorder</strong> - The disableu_idonorder attribute can be used to disable a template or set of templates when another template is ordered, including itself. Once the attribute is added on a template, a single u_id can be added or a comma separated list of u_id’s can be added to disable those templates from being added to the same order. Common uses are for forcing the requirement to only order 1 proof print size per order, such as disabling 3x5, 4x5, 5x5, and 5x7 sizes when a 4x6 is ordered. The disableu_idonorder attribute on the 4x6 would list the u_id’s of the 3x5, 4x5, 5x5 and 5x7, and each of these sizes would have all the other templates’ u_id’s listed in disableu_idonorder to ensure they were mutually exclusive. TIP: To easily obtain the needed list of template u_id’s, select each of the desired templates to become disabled (hold CTRL (Windows) or OPT (OS X) key down as you click on each) and then right click on one of the selected items, and choose Copy u_id’s to clipboard from the list. Select the product where the u_id’s need to be listed in disabledu_idonorder and paste them into the value field.</p>
<p><strong>displayinset</strong> - Define value for the crop area to be used by a template, i.e. .75 for 75 percent.  This is useful to reduce used area in order show images from options such as frames, so that they do not get cut off by the sides of the crop area.</p>
<p><strong>dp2_banner</strong> – DP2 Book specific for banner value</p>
<p><strong>dp2_bleed</strong> – DP2 Book specific for bleed value</p>
<p><strong>dp2_devicetype</strong> – DP2 Book specific, such as value of:  nexpress</p>
<p><strong>dp2_inkname</strong> – DP2 Book specific, such as value: NexPress Dry Ink Clear</p>
<p><strong>dp2_produce</strong> – Should only be used as false if needed; defines whether or not to produce in DP2.  The default condition is true.</p>
<p><strong>true</strong> This template should be produced in DP2 (never needed to set true)<br>
<strong>false</strong> This template should not be produced in DP2</p>
<p><strong>dp2_templatename</strong> – DP2 Book specific, such as value of: 6.5x6.5 Soft Cov 2 S</p>
<p><strong>enablewhenordertotal</strong> - The enablewhenordertotal attribute allows you to set up a special offer template that will only become enabled when the order total reaches the value entered. For example, you can offer a free 16x20 with a $25 order by setting up the special 16x20 with a 0.00 price, adding enablewhenordertotal and setting the value to 25. This attribute should be used with disableu_idonorder to re-disable it’s own u_id value upon being ordered, and also the nextselectedonorder attribute to list the u_id of the first product in the catalog to ensure the customer cannot stay on the product and order more than one.</p>
<p><strong>fit</strong> -  defines whether to crop of fit the full image inside the nodes in the template</p>
<p><strong>true</strong> fit on all nodes<br>
<strong>false</strong> crop on all nodes</p>
<p><strong>icon</strong> - Enter a url to and image file to use as the sizes palette icon for this template</p>
<p><strong>id</strong> layout id for lab business use, often same as layoutfile upon</p>
<p><strong>inheritoptions</strong><br>
<strong>true</strong> options defined on parent templates apply to this template<br>
<strong>false</strong> options defined on parent templates do not apply to this template</p>
<p><strong>initialtemplates</strong> - Enter template a comma delimited set of of u_id’s for the 2 desired templates to list as the default page pairs when the book is initially opened (templates must exist in the section’s templates!).  These 2 pages will populate through all of the pages up to the itemcountminimum.</p>
<p><strong>isdp2book</strong> - used to define a group of templates as a package (a ROES package)</p>
<p><strong>true</strong> this template is a packaging comprising its children<br>
<strong>false</strong> this template is a group or tab</p>
<p><strong>ispackage</strong> - (Generally this has been replaced by containertype) used to define a group of templates as a package (a ROES package)</p>
<p><strong>true</strong> this template is a packaging comprising its children<br>
<strong>false</strong> this template is a group or tab</p>
<p><strong>itemcountmaximum</strong>  - Numeric value to define the maximum number of pages that can be in this section</p>
<p><strong>itemcountminimum</strong>  - Numeric value to define the minimum number of pages that can be in this section</p>
<p><strong>jobtext</strong> - Text passed as-is to Kodak’s DP2 software to affect the job at print time</p>
<p><strong>layoutfile</strong> - DP2 layout file or Package name, Frontline or  Fuji  unit or Composite file name/value.  DP2 layoutfile listings should retain the .txt extension (i.e. 8x10.txt).  Fuji  unit file listings must be edited to remove the .txt extension (i.e. 4600.txt should be listied only as 4600).  Fuji  composites/templates should be listed with a composite designation followed by the unit file and the template (i.e. COMP(48,2BB01V) where the 48 is a base 4x8 unit and the 2BB01V is a greeting card template).</p>
<p><strong>layoutimage</strong> - layout background image URL, used with backgroundbackground, and should ideally be a PNG image (Portable Network Graphics) with alphachannels/saved for web in Photoshop for transparency over image nodes.  Must be a full URL, i.e. <a href="http://www.domain.com/imagename.png">http://www.domain.com/imagename.png</a>.</p>
<p><strong>layoutimagestretched</strong>  - When set to false disables the ROES Client behavior of stretching a layoutimage to conform to a template.</p>
<p><strong>true</strong>  - Client default behavior: layoutimage defined should be stretched to fit the product applied over</p>
<p><strong>false</strong>  - layoutimage defined should NOT be stretched to fit the product applied over</p>
<p><strong>lockpage</strong>  - Enables a ROES book page to be locked into it’s place in the section layout, such as forcing a month into a calendar slot or a blank back into a proof book (should only be used false).</p>
<p><strong>true</strong>  - This template should be locked and cannot be changed by the user by a drag and drop from the book filmstrip</p>
<p><strong>false</strong>  - This template is unlocked and users can alter the template(s) in it (the default condition in ROES so should never appear set to false)</p>
<p><strong>locksection</strong>  - Enables a ROES book section to be locked to prevent template replacement (should only be used true).</p>
<p><strong>true</strong>  - This template book section is locked and cannot be changed by the user</p>
<p><strong>false</strong>  - This template book section is unlocked and users can alter the template(s) in it (the default condition in ROES so should never appear set to false)</p>
<p><strong>nextselectedonorder</strong> - The nextselectedonorder attribute allows you to define a u_id of another template to switch to upon ordering the template this attribute exists on. This is most commonly used with enablewhenordertotal for free/special items, to ensure only one of the free/special items can be ordered by moving off of it automatically upon being ordered. For example, you may offer a free 16x20 when the customer’s order reaches $25, and your catalog this exists in starts with an informational product whose u_id is ROESINFO. You would set up the special 16x20 with a 0.00 price, adding enablewhenordertotal and setting the value to 25. To ensure that only one of this item is added per order, add nextselectedonorder and set the value to ROESINFO, so that upon ordering the free product the program automatically switches to the informational template. TIP: You should also add disableu_idonorder on the free/special template and set the value to its’ own u_id. This will ensure the customer cannot return to the free product and order another copy.</p>

<p><strong>templateoffset</strong>  - Widths and height to offset Pager nodes when added to a template above 0,0</p>
<p><strong>tiertype -</strong> allows you to specify price discounts for the same product with the same image in it based on quantity ordered.  Selections:</p>
<p><strong>step</strong> each step level in quantity retains its’ pricing (in example below, 10 items would cost 12.60 - 1st one 1.50, 2nd thru 9th 1.25, 10th 1.10)<br>
<strong>graded</strong> change the cost of lesser quantities when a certain quantity is reached (in the example below, 10 items would cost 11.10 - all 10 would be 1.10 each)<br>
<strong>threshold</strong> used mainly for setting pricing on Shipping Methods and with the uses attribute (see Shipping section), to make this method/option always cost this amount when a given quantity/value is reached (in the 2nd example below order of $50 would charge $12.95 for shipping,  while and order of $200 would charge 0 for shipping to allow for free shipping offers).</p>

<strong>false</strong> option is enabled by default</p>
<p><strong>discount</strong>  –  For use with promocode and code attributes on an option, as follows: The promocode attribute has 2 uses, in an order option to apply to an entire order (all ROES Versions) or on a template level option to discount a product (versions 6.13 and higher). This can be set on an option that prompts for a promotional code to be entered in a needs_text line, and causes a discount on the template or order as either a percentage of the item/order or a whole dollar amount. The u_id of the option used for entry  <strong>MUST be promocode</strong>  and there are 3 attributes needed:  <strong>needs_text</strong>  for the user entry,  <strong>code</strong>  for the value of the promo code(s) that the text entry must match exactly, and  <strong>discount</strong>  for the amount to calculate, i.e. .90 for a 10% discount on the order or -10 for a $10 discount (negative numbers will be looked at as a whole dollar amount to be taken off). To utilize multiple promotional codes, simply use comma delimited lists in the code and discount fields, where code could have value of 1234,2345,3456 and discount could have value of .9,.75,-20 for 10% off, 25% off and $20 off for the 3 codes respectively. The number of delimited entries must match between the code and discount fields (5 in each, 10 in each, etc.).</p>

<strong>false</strong> this option should be treated as a common option</p>
<p><strong>jobtext</strong></p>
<p><strong>promocode</strong> - For use with code and discount attributes on an option, as follows: The promocode attribute has 2 uses, in an order option to apply to an entire order (all ROES Versions) or on a template level option to discount a product (versions 6.13 and higher). This can be set on an option that prompts for a promotional code to be entered in a needs_text line, and causes a discount on the template or order as either a percentage of the item/order or a whole dollar amount. The u_id of the option used for entry  <strong>MUST be promocode</strong>  and there are 3 attributes needed:  <strong>needs_text</strong>  for the user entry,  <strong>code</strong>  for the value of the promo code(s) that the text entry must match exactly, and  <strong>discount</strong>  for the amount to calculate, i.e. .90 for a 10% discount on the order or -10 for a $10 discount (negative numbers will be looked at as a whole dollar amount to be taken off). To utilize multiple promotional codes, simply use comma delimited lists in the code and discount fields, where code could have value of 1234,2345,3456 and discount could have value of .9,.75,-20 for 10% off, 25% off and $20 off for the 3 codes respectively. The number of delimited entries must match between the code and discount fields (5 in each, 10 in each, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>rderminimum</strong>  - will not allow an order to be sent if the value in dollars has not been met or exceeded.</p>
<p><strong>priceminimum</strong>  - will force the set value to appear as the order price if a dollar amount below the defined number is ordered.</p>
<p><strong>quantityminimum and/or quantitymaximum</strong>  - quantityminimum will flash a warning message that the specified minimum number of prints has not been reached and not allow the order to be sent.  The quantitymaximum attribute will also flash a warning message that the defined maximum number of prints for an order has been exceeded and some need to be removed.  Additionally, these 2 attributes can be used together with the same value to force a set number of prints into an order, so you can use catalogs to define album sizes where a set number of print pages need to be ordered (like 36 for an 18 page bound album).  Both attributes do list the actual number so customers can know how much they need to add or subtract from the  order, and the default verbiage in the dialog windows can be altered if desired by SoftWorks for your client launch.</p>
<p><strong>ui_columns</strong>  - used to force Order Options options to be listed as a single column when set to 1 (this should be set in the new Retail UI).  For multiple columns, set to any whole number desired.</p>

<p><strong>totalpricemultiplier</strong>  - this attribute, which should be manually typed in, is used on an override addition off of an option to alter the price of an entire order.  It can only take effect once per order, used to override the order price to increase it (i.e. a value of 1.25 to add 25% to an order for rush production or metallic paper type selection) or to decrease the order price (i.e. a value of .95 to give an overall 5% discount on a customer specific template that is used by multiple customers or for a Pick Up At Lab shipping selection where the lab includes basic shipping in their order prices).</p>
<p><strong>The Shipping element has a few attributes that can be used, but none are required:</strong></p>
<p><strong>checkoutpolicies</strong> – plain text or HTML encoded text, including images, to be displayed in the Shipping Method selection pane in the wizard</p>
<p><strong>checkoutpolicyposition</strong> – set to top, bottom, left or right, this defines where in the wizard pane the text of the checkoutpolicies displays (top is the default)</p>

<p><strong>Shipping Methods has several default attributes that must always be left in place (id, label, price, u_id) and others that can be added:</strong></p>
<p><strong>countries</strong> – list of countries to display via drop down list when needsaddress fields are presented (prevents manual entry of data)</p>
<p><strong>default</strong>  – The default attribute can be added onto Shipping Method to pre-select that method for the user.  When added it will default to true as the value, and this is the only way it needs to be added (default never needs to be set to false).</p>
<p><strong>discountable</strong>  – The discountable attribute can be set on a Shipping Method to prevent the price from being considered in a discount percentage calculation.</p>
<p><strong>true</strong>  - This Shipping Method should be discounted (this is the default condition in ROES so does not need to be listed true)</p>
<p><strong>false</strong>  - This Shipping Method should not be discounted</p>
<p><strong>id</strong>  – The id attribute is added by default on a Shipping Method and should remain there.  It can be set with a value to define the accounting or internal code for the Shipping Method listed.</p>
<p><strong>label</strong>  – The label attribute will appear by default to be edited for the name of the Shipping Method, such as ‘UPS Ground’.</p>
<p><strong>needsaddress</strong>  – The needsaddress attribute can be added onto a Shipping Method to create an extra set of fields to be used for a shipping address, usually for drop shipping needs.  It will also be used for calculating tax on the order.</p>
<p><strong>needsaddresspolicies</strong>  – Allows display of plain or HTML encoded text as instructions, etc. when the shipping address field set is presented during the completion wizard</p>
<p><strong>needscounty</strong>  – set to true or false, the needscounty attribute can be added onto a Shipping Method to create an extra county field in the needsaddress field set.  It will also be used for calculating tax on the order, if county values are taken into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>needsphone</strong>  – set to true or false, the needsphone attribute can be added to a Shipping Method with needsaddress to define whether the phone field should be present or not.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>  – The price attribute will appear by default to set the desired price for the Shipping Method.  When used with tiertype and uses, this value can be set to a string of values to help determine the most accurate shipping price for the order.</p>
<p><strong>saveaddress</strong>  - The saveaddress attribute can be added onto a Shipping Method that has needsaddress set on it to retain the needsaddress data between orders.</p>
<p><strong>states</strong>  – The states attribute can be added onto a Shipping Method to define a list of states to be offered via  needsaddress  State  field.</p>
<p><strong>taxable</strong>  – The taxable attribute can be added onto a Shipping Method to define whether or not the Shipping Method should be taxed. By default, Shipping is not taxed in ROES, so this will never be need to be set to false, only true when needed.</p>
<p><strong>true</strong>  - This Shipping Method should be taxed</p>
<p><strong>false</strong>  - This Shipping Method should not be taxed (not needed to be listed false as this is default condition in ROES)</p>
<p><strong>taxrate</strong>  – The taxrate attribute can be added onto a Shipping Method to set a hard tax percentage to be used for calculating tax on the order. This will still apply regardless if address data listed by the customer, and is ideally used for a ‘lab pickup’ Shipping Method where you will always look to charge tax.</p>
<p><strong>tiertype</strong>  – The tiertype attribute can be added onto a Shipping Method to help define the price of the method when used with uses and price. For shipping calculations generally tiertype should only be set to threshold.</p>
<p><strong>u_id</strong>  – The u_id attribute will appear by default on the Shipping Method and should always be left as is.</p>
<p><strong>uses</strong>  - The uses attribute can be added and used to help calculate the price of the Shipping Method based on the price and tiertype values.  It can be set to either price or weight to match the desired calculation, such as the order price or the total of the weight attribute values on products in the order.</p>
<p><strong>Label - The Label element can be added off Shipping and placed above, below, or interspersed with Shipping Methods to act as a separator or presentation of information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>border</strong>  – set to R,G,B values can define a frame to encase the text for a label element</p>
<p><strong>text</strong> – plain text or HTML encoded text, including images, to be displayed in the Shipping Methods selection pane of the completion wizard</p>
<p><strong>autoenqueue</strong> – This attribute should be set at the template level to true or false in order to override the ROES Server’s setting in the Options pane (checkbox for Auto-Enqueue Order Items). In most cases the checkbox in the Server is not selected so autoenqueue is set to true on templates that should bypass this and proceed straight to there queue/the default queue.</p>
<p><strong>outputrender</strong> – The outputrender attribute can be set to false on a node inside a template to keep it from being rendered, such as a guide image, frame, or canvas overlay (never needed to be set to true).</p>
<p><strong>outputrenderlayoutimage</strong> – The outputrenderlayoutimage attribute can be set to false on a template to instruct the ROES Server to ignore the presence of a layoutimage when rendering the product (never needs to be set to true).</p>
<p><strong>preferredqueue</strong> – The preferredqueue attribute is a case sensitive value defined on a template to define what queue to feed into in the ROES Server. It should match the Queue name value in the ROES Server exactly.</p>
<p><strong>printerchannel</strong> – The printerchannel attribute can be added on a template to set the Channel entry for printer such as Noritsu MP1600.</p>
<p><strong>printersurface</strong> – The printersurface attribute can be added on a template to set the Surface entry for printer such as Noritsu MP1600.</p>
<p><strong>qsssurface</strong> – The qsssurface attribute can be added on a template to set the Surface entry for Noritsu Net Order.</p>
<p><strong>sa_pagespan</strong> – The sa_pagespan attribute is to define a panoramic template for rendering. Set to 2 and only add if a pano product.</p>
<p><strong>ROES Server for DP2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>isdp2book</strong>  – The isdp2book attribute</p>
<p><strong>jobtext</strong>  – The jobtext attribute can be added onto any template, node, or option. The text is passed as-is to Kodak’s DP2 software to affect the job at print time.</p>
<p><strong>retouch</strong>  – The retouch attribute can be used on an Image Option in ROES to mark the image for retouch in the KPARS module in DP2.</p>
<p><strong>servercommand</strong> – The servercommand attribute is used to pass additional operations into DP2 (defined further in the ROES DP2 Server User’s Guide).</p>
<p><strong>templateoffset</strong> – The templateoffset attribute can be set on a template as x,y coordinates to alter the bounds of user drawn nodes when passed back into the ROES Server for DP2.</p>
