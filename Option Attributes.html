  <div class="stackedit__html"><p><strong>For use on Option parents</strong></p>
<p><strong>expanded</strong><br>
<strong>true</strong> option group should be expanded initially (default)<br>
<strong>false</strong> option group should be collapsed initially</p>
<p><strong>mandatory</strong><br>
<strong>true</strong> user must select one from the list, with the first option in the list being added by default<br>
<strong>false</strong> user can select none</p>
<p><strong>multiple_choice</strong><br>
<strong>true</strong> user can select multiple<br>
<strong>false</strong> user can only select one (default behavior for option sets)</p>
<p><strong>required</strong>  – For Order Options usage only:  user must select an option from the list, however none will be pre-selected.  An alert window will be shown when the customer tries to complete the order if the user fails to select one of the child options.</p>
<p><strong>ui_columns</strong>  - used to force a template group to a set level of columns, expressed as a whole number.</p>
<p><strong>For use on selectable options</strong></p>
<p><strong>code</strong> – For use with promocode and discount attributes on an option, as follows: The promocode attribute has 2 uses, in an order option to apply to an entire order (all ROES Versions) or on a template level option to discount a product (versions 6.13 and higher). This can be set on an option that prompts for a promotional code to be entered in a needs_text line, and causes a discount on the template or order as either a percentage of the item/order or a whole dollar amount. The u_id of the option used for entry  <strong>MUST be promocode</strong>  and there are 3 attributes needed:  <strong>needs_text</strong>  for the user entry,  <strong>code</strong>  for the value of the promo code(s) that the text entry must match exactly, and  <strong>discount</strong>  for the amount to calculate, i.e. .90 for a 10% discount on the order or -10 for a $10 discount (negative numbers will be looked at as a whole dollar amount to be taken off). To utilize multiple promotional codes, simply use comma delimited lists in the code and discount fields, where code could have value of 1234,2345,3456 and discount could have value of .9,.75,-20 for 10% off, 25% off and $20 off for the 3 codes respectively. The number of delimited entries must match between the code and discount fields (5 in each, 10 in each, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>disableu_id</strong> - expressed as a single, or comma delimited set of, u_ids of other options to disable when this option is selected.  As in the example below, a lab may offer multiple types of retouching, L:ight, Standard and Heavy.  Each of these selectable options would have its’ own u_id, and a disableu_id attribute line listed as below with the u_id’s of the other 2 retouching selections.  When one was selected the other 2 would be grayed out and made unselectable, as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>disabled</strong><br>
